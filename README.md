This project was commissioned by the Orbital Mechanics course during my first year of the Master's program in Space Engineering..
The project consisted in two assignments, the first assignment was a study of an interplanetary mission and optimization of the maneuvers in order to minimize the propellant needed. The second assignment consisted in studying the effects of recurring perturbances on a satellite orbiting around Earth.
Both assignments were solved through the use of the Matlab environment to simulate both cases and obtain the required results.
